# Book Search Engine

## Description

This application is a search engine for books. The user is presented with a search input field and submit button, as well as an option to login or signup. A search will result in several results, each featuring a bookâ€™s title, author, description, image, and a link to that book on the [Google Books](https://books.google.com/intl/en/googlebooks/about/index.html) site. One must be logged in to enable the capability to save books, which are compiled into a retrievable list with the option to remove previously saved titles.  

Behind the scenes, it consists of a [Google Books API](https://developers.google.com/books) search engine, built with a [RESTful API](https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/restful-api/), which is then refactored to be a [GraphQL API](https://graphql.org/learn/) with [Apollo Server](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/). It is a full-stack MERN application ([MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)-[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)-[React](https://reactjs.org/)-[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)), deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/what) with a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) database using [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database).
